# AptReviews

### GA WDI NYC Jan 14, Project 1

### Overview 

**AptReviews** is an apartment review app where you can search or add apartments, attach links to listings from other websites (like NakedApartments, Craigslist, etc.), and, most importantly, review them! It aims to save apartment hunter's time in looking for apartments by being able to see reviews. "It's like Yelp! for apartments!" 

This app was developed as a sample Rails project for General Assembly's WDI course. It was developed over a five day sprint to model the agile software development process.
